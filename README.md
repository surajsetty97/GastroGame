Game created by Victor Chien and Suraj Setty

The game consists of a main avatar consuming "+" shaped icons which will bounce around the screen. In addition, there will be red blobs which will apply a strike when consumed, 3 strikes meaning game over. The purpose is to consume as many green blobs as possible without hitting any red ones. There are also a few bonus blobs which may appear while playing.

To run the game, run the Game.java main method. Hope you enjoy!
